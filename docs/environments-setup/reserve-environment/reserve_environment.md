### **The lab environment**

Six Linux VM has been provided for this lab. The environment should start automatically and will take several minutes to be **ready**. 

If the environment does not automatically start, click the **start** icon at the top of the VMs list, to start **ALL** of the VMs.

**Note:** If the Skytap Cloud environment resources approach capacity limits, you may experience delays in **stating** the environment. If this occurs, you will see `rate limited` messages. Not to worry, the environment will start, but just be delayed while the system is busy. Under certain circumstances, it may take up to **20 minutes** for the environment to start.

**Note:** The `desktop` VM is the VM you will login to and use in the lab.

The login credentials for the **desktop** image is:

  - User ID: **ibmuser**
 
  - Password: **engageibm\!**


Now you are ready to use the specific lab guides to setup for demos or self-enablement. 

The labs are available from the **Navigation** pane on the left side of the page.
