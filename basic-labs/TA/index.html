<p>This lab is a part of the <strong>Teaching your monolith to dance</strong> Application
Modernization lab series which focuses on the evaluation, re-platforming
and rehosting application modernization approaches and other application
modernization related solutions. This lab provides fundamental hands-on
experience of the evaluation process. It shows the value of using
Transformation Advisor to evaluate on-premises Java applications and
identify a migration candidate for moving to the cloud. When you
complete this lab, you learn how to use this tool to quickly analyze
on-premises Java applications without accessing their source code and to
estimate the move to cloud efforts.</p>
<p><strong>IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor</strong> (Transformation Advisor) is an
application modernization tool that is entitled through IBM WebSphere
Hybrid Edition. Transformation Advisor helps you quickly evaluate
on-premises Java EE applications for deployment to the cloud. The
Transformation Advisor tool can</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>identify the Java EE programming models in the app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>determine the complexity of apps by listing a high-level inventory
    of the content and structure of each app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>highlight Java EE programming model and WebSphere API differences
    between the WebSphere profile types</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify Java EE specification implementation differences that might
    affect the app</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the tool provides a recommendation for the right-fit IBM
WebSphere Application Server edition and offers advice, best practices,
and potential solutions to assess the ease of moving apps to Liberty or
newer versions of WebSphere traditional. It accelerates application
migrating to cloud process, minimize errors and risks and reduce time to
market.</p>
<p><strong>1. Business Scenario</strong></p>
<p>As shown in the image below, your company has several web applications
deployed to WebSphere Application Server (WAS) environment.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/media/image1.png" /></p>
<p>Your company wants to move these applications to a lightweight WebSphere
Liberty server on cloud, but you are not sure how much effort the
migration process might take. You decide to use the IBM Transformation
Advisor to do a quick evaluation of these applications without their
source code to identify a good candidate application to move to cloud
based on the analysis result.</p>
<p><strong>2. Objective</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this lab are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>learn how to collect Java application and configuration data using
    the Transformation Advisor Data Collector tool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learn how to use the Transformation Advisor to evaluate the move to
    cloud efforts and to identify the good candidate for migration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Prerequisites</strong></p>
<p>The following prerequisites must be completed prior to beginning this
lab:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Familiarity with basic Linux commands</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have internet access</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a SkyTap App Mod Lab environment ready</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. What is Already Completed</strong></p>
<p>A six Linux VMs App Mod Lab environment has been provided for this lab.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/media/image2.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) v4.6, is installed in
    6 VMs with 3 master nodes / compute nodes (the master nodes are
    serving as computer nodes as well).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>master1 VM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>master2 VM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>master3 VM,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dns VM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nfs VM, with 3 master nodes / compute nodes (the master nodes
    are serving as computer nodes as well).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>desktop VM</strong> is the one you will use to access and work with
    OCP cluster in this lab.</p>

    <strong>ibmuser</strong> Password: <strong>engageibm</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Lab Tasks</strong></p>
<p>In this lab, you access WebSphere Application Server to review the
deployment of the JEE applications. Then you are going to the
Transformation Advisor to identify a good candidate application for
moving to cloud. To identify which Java EE programming models are on the
server, you could run the Transformation Advisor Data Collector tool
against the server.</p>
<p>The Transformation Advisor creates an inventory of the content and
structure of each application and learn about problems that might occur
if you move the application to cloud. Finally, you review the analysis
reports to determine the complexity of the move-to-cloud efforts and
select the migration candidate app.</p>
<p>Here are the activities involved in this process:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Log in to WebSphere Application Server to review the deployed JEE
    applications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the Transformation Advisor Data Collector tool against the
    WebSphere Application Server to get application data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review the analysis reports that Transformation Advisor generates to
    identify the right candidate application for a rapid and
    cost-effective migration to cloud</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" src="images/media/image17.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>6.4 Download Transformation Advisor Data Collector utility</strong></p>
<p>The Transformation Advisor can evaluate any Java based applications. In
this lab, you are going to use it to evaluate whether the on-premises
WebSphere application, <strong>Mod Resorts</strong>, is suitable to move to cloud and
what the effort might be to get it there.</p>
<p>You can use Transformation Advisor Data Collector utility to get the
application data and server configuration from the WebSphere Application
Server running on the desktop VM. The utility can be downloaded from the
Transformation Advisor web page and is illustrated in the following
steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Transformation Advisor page, you first create a new workspace
    by clicking on the <strong>Create New</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="images/media/image18.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>On the <strong>Create a new workspace</strong> page, enter the workspace name as
    <strong>Evaluation</strong> and then click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="images/media/image19.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: A workspace is a designated area that houses the migration
recommendations provided by Transformation Advisor against your
application server environment. You can name and organize these
however you want, whether it’s by business application, location, or
teams.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Enter the collection name as <strong>Server1</strong> and click <strong>Create</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="images/media/image20.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Each workspace can be divided into collections for more
focused assessment and planning. Like workspaces, collections can be
named and organized in whatever way you want.</p>
<p>Once the <strong>Workspace</strong> and <strong>Collection</strong> are created, you have
options to either download the Data Collector utility or upload
existing data file. In this lab, you are going to first use the Data
Collector utility to collect the application and configuration from
the WebSphere environment. Once you have the data collected from
WebSphere, then it is possible to choose to Upload the collected data
to Transformation Advisor for analysis.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Download</strong> to go to the data collector tool download page.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="images/media/image21.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Download</strong> page, you can download different version of the
    utility based on your source operating system. It also shows how to
    use the utility in command line to collect application data from
    WebSphere, WebLogic, and Tomcat servers. Since the lab VM is a Linux
    OS, click <strong>Download for Linux</strong> to get the utility.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="ta download dc" src="images/media/image22.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>In the Download dialog window, select the <strong>Save File</strong> option and
    click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="ta save dc" src="images/media/image23.png" /></p>
<p>The zipped Data Collector utility file is saved in
<strong>/home/ibmuser/Downloads</strong> directory of the lab desktop VM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>6.5 Run Transformation Advisor Data Collector utility</strong></p>
<p>After downloading the zipped Data Collector utility, you need to unpack
it and run the utility against the WAS server to collect all deployed
applications and their configuration data from WAS server.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go back to the terminal window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the terminal window, navigate the /home/ibmuser/Downloads
    directory and view its contents with commands:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>cd /home/ibmuser/Downloads/</p>
<p>ls -l</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You see the downloaded data collector utility file saved in the
    directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extract the data collector utility using the following command:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>tar xvfz transformationadvisor-Linux_Evaluation_Server1.tgz</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The data collector utility is extracted to
    <strong>/home/ibmuser/Downloads/transformationadvisor-X.Y.Z</strong> directory,
    where X.Y.Z is the version of the tool downloaded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execute the Data Collector utility with the commands below to start
    collect the deployed applications information on the WAS server.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>cd /home/ibmuser/Downloads/transformationadvisor-X.Y.Z</p>
<p>Note: Substitute X.Y.Z with the version number of the Transformation
Advisor tool that was downloaded</p>
<p>./bin/transformationadvisor -w /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer -p
AppSrv01 wsadmin passw0rd</p>
<p>Type <strong>1</strong> 1to accept the license agreement and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>The utility starts to collect application data. This process takes
sometimes to complete depending on how many applications deployed on
the WAS server. In this lab, it might be a few minutes. When it is
done, you see output like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/media/image24.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your application data is collected, it is saved as a <strong>zip file</strong>
    under the collector tool directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>View the tool directory with command, you see the <strong>AppSrv01.zip</strong>
    file is created.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>ls -l</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Sample Output:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="images/media/image25.png" /></p>
<p>In general, if your application server and the Transformation Advisor
are in the same network infrastructure, the collected data is
automatically uploaded to Transformation Advisor for you to view the
analysis results. Otherwise, you must manually upload the data to
Transformation Advisor before you can view them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>6.6 Evaluate On-Premises Java Applications</strong></p>
<p>In this section, you are going to use the Transformation Advisor UI to
view the application data analysis results that was collected in the
previous section.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go back to Transformation Advisor page in web browser, click the
    <strong>Server1</strong> link to go to the Recommendations page.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="ta server1 link" src="images/media/image26.png" /></p>
<p>In the Recommendations page, you can see all applications deployed to
the WAS server are listed.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/media/image27.png" /></p>
<p>On the Recommendations page, the identified migration <strong>source
environment</strong> is shown in the <strong>Profile</strong> section, and the <strong>target
environment</strong> is shown in the <strong>Preferred migration</strong> section.</p>
<p>The data collector tool detects that the source environment is your
WebSphere Application Server AppSrv01 profile.</p>
<p>The target environment is <strong>Liberty Runtimes</strong>, which is the default
target environment.</p>
<p>The Recommendations page also shows the summary analysis results for
all the apps in the AppSrv01 environment to be moved to a Liberty on
OpenShift environment. For each app, you can see these results:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Migration Target</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complexity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Estimated development cost (in days)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, if you want to move the <strong>modresorts-1_0_war.ear</strong>
application to Open Liberty, the complexity level is Simple, which
indicates that the application code does not need to be changed before
it can be moved to cloud. The application has no dependency, has two
minor level issue and the estimated development effort is zero day
because no code change is required.</p>
<p>As you can see the default move to cloud environment is <strong>Liberty
Runtimes</strong>, however Transformation Advisor can also provide migration
options if you want to migrate your application to different target
environments as shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/media/image28.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>In this lab you are focusing on identifying a good candidate for
    &gt; moving to the Open Liberty on OpenShift environment, so switch to
    &gt; the <strong>Compatible Runtimes</strong> view, which will show additional
    &gt; target runtime options, and their respective complexity of moving
    &gt; the application t that target environment.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="images/media/image29.png" /></p>
<p>For this lab, you will focus on the modernization of
<strong>moderesorts-1.0_war.ear</strong> to Open Liberty. Next, you will look at
the analysis results for <strong>moderesorts-1.0_war.ear</strong> application in
detail.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>modresorts-1_0_war.ear</strong> link targeting <strong>Open
    Liberty</strong> to expand its analysis results.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="images/media/image30.png" /></p>
<p>The first section in the detail analysis summary page is the
Complexity section. The overall complexity for the application is
simple, indicating that the application can be directly moved to cloud
without any code change.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/media/image31.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Scroll down to <strong>Complexity Rules</strong> section. You can see although
    there is no code change required and no development cost, the
    estimate migration over all develop cost is 0 days. This estimate is
    based on data from IBM Services engagements, which includes
    migrating management, server configuration, and testing.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="images/media/image32.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Expand the <strong>Issues and issues details</strong> section. You can see the
    only minor potential issue listed is on configuring the application
    in Docker container.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <strong>Technology report</strong> lists all java technologies the application
used and whether these technologies are supported by a specific
WebSphere platform from Liberty for Java on IBM Cloud to WebSphere
traditional for z/OS. It is used to determine whether a particular
WebSphere product is suitable for an application.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/media/image36.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see from the report, the Mod Resorts application only uses
<strong>Java Servlet</strong> which is supported by all WebSphere editions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go back to the Transformation Advisor page and click the <strong>Inventory
    Report</strong> link.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="images/media/image44.png" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Inventory Report</strong> shows up. This report helps you examine what
is in your application, including the number of modules, their
relationships, and the technologies in those modules. It also gives
you a view of all the utility JAR files in the application that tend
to accumulate over time. Potential deployment problems and performance
considerations are also included.</p>
<p><img alt="ta inventory report" src="images/media/image45.png" /></p>
<p>a. Scroll down to view this report which serves as good
decision-making tool to info you what is inside your application
runtime, and to help you to have a better understanding of the
application runtime, the components it has and the relationships among
them.</p>
<p><img alt="ta inventory report 2" src="images/media/image46.png" /></p>
<p>From the analysis reports you looked at above, you know that the Mod
Resorts application is supported by Open Liberty which is the target
environment, and the issue that the tool identified would not affect
the application migration. You can confidently select the application
as a good candidate for moving to Open Liberty in containers in the
repackage process with minimum effort.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Now you know that the Mod Resorts application can be moved to
    Liberty, you want to know if it is also a good candidate for
    re-platform with traditional WebSphere in containers. To do that
    switch the target environment from <strong>Compatible Liberty Runtime</strong> to
    <strong>WebSphere traditional</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="images/media/image47.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see from the TA recommendation that the Mod Resorts
application is also a good candidate for re-hosting in WAS Base
container on cloud. If you want to review the recommendation details,
you can follow the same steps you did before to go over them.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/media/image48.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>OPTIONAL:</strong> Evaluate the PlantsByWebSphere Application</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>You can follow the same procedure you did for the Mod Resorts
application to view the analysis results for any of the other
applications that was analyzed, such as
<strong>CustomerOrderServicesApp.ear</strong> application.</p>
<p>As you can see from the Summary list, the recommendations for the
application to move to cloud are as follows:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The complexity level is Simple, for WebSphere Liberty and WebSphere
    Traditional, which means that the application code can be deployed
    to Liberty on OpenShift without any changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The estimated development effort is 0 day because no code changes
    are needed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

<p><strong>6.7 View the Mod Resorts application</strong></p>
<p>From the analysis you did above, you know that the Mod Resorts
application is a good candidate for moving to cloud, you can view how
the application looks like, as it is currently running in the WebSphere
Traditional server on the desktop VM.</p>
<ol>
<li>From the web browser window, click new Tab to open a new browser
    window. Type the Mod Resorts application URL:
    <strong>http://localhost:9080/resorts/</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Explore the migration bundle for the Mod Resorts application<br />
</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Transformation Advisor will display details about the <strong>migration
bundle</strong> that it generated to accelerate the modernization of
applications to containers in OpenShift. The migration bundle includes
diverse artifacts, depending on the needs of the application to
accelerate the build and deployment of an application Docker image into
OpenShift platform.  </p>
<p>The user can choose to create a migration bundle for either</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>binary</strong> project of an application (uploading a WAR/EAR file and
    its dependent libraries)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>source code</strong> project of an application, so that the application
    source files can be modernized and maintained</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, let’s quickly explore a Migration Plan for the Mod Resorts
application to see the artifacts that Transformation Advisor creates to
expedite the app deployment to OpenShift Platform.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click on the menu with the “hamburger icon” next to the ModResorts
    application analysis to display the menu choices and choose <strong>View
    migration plan</strong>:  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/media/image53.png" /></p>
</li>
<li>

    option.  </p>
<p>To accelerate the application modernization, the artifacts produced
by Transformation Advisor include:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<!-- end list -->

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>server.xml</strong>: the configuration for the Liberty server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>pom.xml</strong>: Build the application using Maven</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Application CR</strong>: Custom Resource for the application to be
    deployed to OpenShift via the Open Liberty Operator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dockerfile</strong>: Create the Docker image for the application</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The user will be able to choose to download the artifacts as a
migration bundle or push the bundle contents into a GitHub
repository.  </p>
